# portfolio

Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

Developing my portfolio website felt very personal to me compared to the other projects because I'm presenting my own works and "selling" my services to potential clients. Initially, I felt challenged having a cohesive brand design for myself. I searched for tons of inspiration from different websites online but eventually learned that I should look from within me to finally come up with the design. Another thing that I find myself struggling with was the fact that I am not an experienced web developer yet I keep coming up with web design that is complicated and a bit challenging for my level. I just had to find the right balance with interesting and "edgy" design and easy-to-code web design. After facing all those challenges, I have learned that being a media designer is a lot of challenge because we have to be familiar with all forms of media yet it is so exciting. I am looking forward to more challenges and new knowledge as a designer.
